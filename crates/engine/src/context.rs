//! Application context – holds capability trait objects and config.
//!
//! Two layers, mirroring the transport design:
//! - [`AppContext`] holds the shared OS capabilities (fs/net). It is
//!   built once at process/transport start and shared (e.g. behind an `Arc` in
//!   the HTTP server's state).
//! - [`Ctx`] is constructed **per request/invocation**, borrowing the shared
//!   capabilities and carrying request-scoped data (`request_id`, `deadline`).
//!   Commands receive `&Ctx`. This is the seam where auth/identity would later
//!   attach - no identity field exists yet, by design.
