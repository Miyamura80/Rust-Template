//! `appctl mcp` - placeholder for the future MCP transport.
//!
//! MCP is **designed-for but not built** this iteration (see the PRD §8 and
//! `docs/mcp.md`). It needs nothing new from `engine`: the typed command
//! registry already exposes `registry.schemas()` / `registry.schema(name)`,
//! which is exactly what an adapter maps `tools/list` → schemas and
//! `tools/call` → `registry.call` onto. This stub keeps the subcommand surface
//! stable until the adapter lands, and is intentionally ungated (like `init`
//! and `new`) so it survives surface pruning.

/// Print the "not implemented" notice and exit with `EX_UNAVAILABLE` (69).
